                    Superman is an ongoing American comic book series featuring the DC Comics superhero Superman as the
                    main protagonist. Superman began as one of several anthology features in the National Periodical
                    Publications comic book Action Comics #1 in June 1938. The strip proved so popular that National
                    launched Superman into his own self-titled comic book, the first for any superhero, premiering with
                    the cover date Summer 1939. Between 1986 and 2006 it was retitled The Adventures of Superman while a
                    new series used the title Superman. In May 2006, it was returned to its original title and
                    numbering. The title was canceled with issue #714 in 2011, and was relaunched with issue #1 the
                    following month which ended its run in 2016. A fourth series was released with issue #1 in June 2016
                    and ended in April 2018. A fifth series with new issue #1 will be launched in July 2018.

                <p>
                    Due to the Superman character's popularity after his premiere in Action Comics #1, National Allied
                    Publications decided to launch an entirely new magazine featuring a single character, which at that
                    time
                    was unprecedented.[1] Superman #1 appeared on the shelves in the summer of 1939. Superman now also
                    had
                    the distinction of being the first ever hero-character featured in more than one comic magazine. By
                    issue #7, Superman was being hailed on the covers as the "World's Greatest Adventure Strip
                    Character".
                    Perry White, a supporting character who had originated on the Superman radio program was introduced
                    into
                    the comic book in issue #7 (October 1940).[2] Editor Mort Weisinger began his long association with
                    the
                    title with issue #11 (July–August 1941).[3] Jimmy Olsen first appeared as a named character in the
                    story
                    "Superman versus The Archer" in Superman #13 (Nov.–Dec. 1941).[4][5] In the early 1940s, Superman
                    was
                    selling over a million copies per month.[6] By 1942, artist Wayne Boring, who had previously been
                    one of
                    Shuster's assistants, had become a major artist on Superman.[7] Superman #23 (July–August 1943)
                    featured
                    the first Superman comic book story written by someone other than Jerry Siegel.[8] The story
                    "America's
                    Secret Weapon!" was written by Don Cameron despite bearing Siegel's signature.[9] Siegel introduced
                    Mister Mxyzptlk in issue #30 (September 1944).[10] A more detailed origin story for Superman was
                    presented in issue #53 (July 1948) to mark the character's tenth anniversary.[11] Another part of
                    the
                    Superman mythos which had originated on the radio program made its way into the comic books when
                    kryptonite was featured in a story by Bill Finger and Al Plastino.[12]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Superman was the first DC title with a letters column as a regular feature beginning with issue #124
                    (September 1958).[13] In the view of comics historian Les Daniels, artist Curt Swan became the
                    definitive artist of Superman in the early 1960s with a "new look" to the character that replaced
                    Wayne
                    Boring's version.[14] Writer Jim Shooter and Swan crafted the story "Superman's Race With the
                    Flash!" in
                    Superman #199 (Aug. 1967) which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman, two
                    characters
                    known for their super-speed powers.[15]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Julius Schwartz became the title's editor with issue #233 (January 1971)[16] and together with
                    writer
                    Denny O'Neil and artist Curt Swan streamlined the Superman mythos, starting with the elimination of
                    Kryptonite.[17] Elliot S. Maggin began his long association with the title with the story "Must
                    There Be
                    a Superman?" in issue #247 (Jan. 1972).[18][19] Writer Cary Bates, in collaboration with Swan,
                    introduced such characters as the supervillain Terra-Man in issue #249 (March 1972)[20] and the
                    superhero Vartox in issue #281 (Nov. 1974).[21] Issues #272 (Feb. 1974), #278 (Aug. 1974), and #284
                    (Feb. 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format.[22] Superman #300 (June
                    1976)
                    featured an out-of-continuity story by Bates and Maggin which imagined the infant Superman landing
                    on
                    Earth in 1976 and becoming a superhero in 2001. The tale was an inspiration for Mark Millar's
                    Superman:
                    Red Son limited series published in 2003.[23] DC's parent company Warner Communications reinstated
                    the
                    byline for Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster which had been dropped decades earlier[24][25][26] and the
                    first
                    issue with the restored credit was Superman #301 (August 1976).[27] Martin Pasko and Swan created
                    the
                    Master Jailer character in issue #331 (January 1979).[28] The bottle city of Kandor, which had been
                    introduced in 1958, was restored to normal size in a story by Len Wein and Swan in Superman #338
                    (August
                    1979).[29]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The series reached issue #400 in October 1984. That issue featured work by several popular comics
                    artists including the only major DC work by Jim Steranko as well as an introduction by noted
                    science-fiction author Ray Bradbury.[30][31] Superman ran uninterrupted until the mid-1980s, when DC
                    Comics instituted a line-wide relaunch with the 1985 event maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths.
                    Folding their vast multiverse into a single shared universe, Superman and his supporting cast would
                    receive a massive overhaul at the hands of writer/artist John Byrne. One last story, which also
                    marked
                    the end of Schwartz' tenure as editor of the series,[16] was published to give a send-off to the
                    former
                    status quo: Alan Moore's Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?[32] The story's first part saw
                    publication in Superman #423, which would be the last issue before the title was relaunched with its
                    legacy numbering as The Adventures of Superman.[33] Superman was relaunched with a new #1 issue in a
                    second volume in 1986,[34] and was published concurrently with The Adventures of Superman.

                    Jurgens
                    worked on the title from 1989–1991. Hank Henshaw, a character who would later become the Cyborg
                    Superman, first appeared in issue #466 (May 1990).[40] By the late 1980s, the plots of the Superman
                    books were often linked. To coordinate the storyline and sequence of event, from January 1991 to
                    January
                    2002, "triangle numbers" (or "shield numbers") appeared on the cover of each Superman comic book.
                    During
                    these years, the Superman storylines ran with the story continuing through the titles Superman,
                    Action
                    Comics and later in two further series, Superman: The Man of Steel and Superman: The Man of
                    Tomorrow.

                    Jerry Ordway returned as writer of the title with issue #480 (July 1991).[41] Tom Grummett drew part
                    of
                    #480 and became the main artist on the series with the following issue.[42] The series participated
                    in
                    the crossover storyline "Panic in the Sky" in 1992.[43] During their run on The Adventures of
                    Superman,
                    Grummett and Ordway (along with editor Mike Carlin and others) were the architects of "The Death of
                    Superman" storyline, in which Superman died and was resurrected. It was during that storyline, that
                    Grummett and writer Karl Kesel, created the new Superboy in The Adventures of Superman #500 (June
                    1993).[44] Other crossovers the series participated in included Zero Hour: Crisis in Time,[45] The
                    Final
                    Night,[46] and Infinite Crisis.[47]

                    As of the start of 2002, the integration between the Superman titles became less frequent, and the
                    remaining issues of The Adventures of Superman commonly carried self-contained stories. Issue #600
                    (March 2002) was a double-sized special featuring Superman combating Lex Luthor.[48] The final issue
                    (#649) was part of a three-part crossover with Superman and Action Comics, an homage to the Earth-2
                    Superman in the wake of events in the limited series Infinite Crisis.

                    For its last two years, The Adventures of Superman was written by Greg Rucka.[49] His stories
                    included
                    the villain Ruin, the attempted assassination of Lois Lane and a number of Mister Mxyzptlk
                    appearances.

                    Adventures of Superman was relaunched on April 29, 2013. Unlike the previous volume, the new series
                    is
                    not set in the mainstream DC Universe continuity but instead features anthology style stories with
                    rotating creative teams in the same format as the second Legends of the Dark Knight series. It is
                    released as a digital-first comic with print publication to follow. The first story was to have been
                    written by Orson Scott Card and drawn by Chris Sprouse and Karl Story.[50] Card's participation in
                    the
                    project became an issue. DC Comics responded to a petition that he be dropped with a statement that
                    it
                    supported freedom of expression and that the personal views of individuals associated with the
                    company
                    were not the views of the company. Illustrator Chris Sprouse left the project due to the media
                    attention
                    and some comic book stores announced a boycott.[51] Card's Superman story is now "on hold" and will
                    not
                    be included in either the scheduled print or digital issues and was replaced by a story written by
                    Jeff
                    Parker.[52] The relaunched Adventures of Superman series came to an end with issue #17, released in
                    September 2014.[53]

                    Superman volume 2 reached issue #226 (April 2006) and was then canceled as part of the linewide
                    Infinite
                    Crisis event. The Adventures of Superman was returned to its original title, Superman, with issue
                    #650
                    (May 2006),[54] as a part of the "One Year Later" banner. Superman had a crossover with Action
                    Comics,
                    titled "Up, Up and Away!" co-written by Geoff Johns and Kurt Busiek with art by Pete Woods. This
                    storyline told of Clark Kent attempting to protect Metropolis without his powers until eventually
                    regaining them. Busiek became the sole writer of the series with issue #654 (September 2006) and
                    Carlos
                    Pacheco became the series' artist.[55] The series participated in the weekly series Countdown to
                    Final
                    Crisis, giving a different perspective on certain events shown in the weekly title, such as the
                    events
                    preceding the death of New God Lightray.

                <p>
                    Busiek and Pacheco developed an extended storyine featuring Arion coming into conflict with
                    Superman.[56] The plotline concluded in Superman Annual #13.[57] Alex Ross painted the covers for
                    issues
                    #675 (June 2008) through #685 (April 2009).

                <p>
                    James Robinson replaced Busiek with issue #677 (August 2008).[58] Robinson's run on the title began
                    with
                    "The Coming of Atlas" story arc and began a link between Superman, Action Comics, and Supergirl that
                    started a long-form narrative with the New Krypton event. The majority of Robinson's run featured
                    Mon-El
                    and the Guardian as the featured characters, while Superman himself had gone to live on the planet
                    New
                    Krypton. Robinson's last full issue was #699, tying into Last Stand of New Krypton, and he finished
                    his
                    run in a short story in issue #700 (August 2010) that returned Superman to Earth.[59][60] Superman
                    #700
                    also saw writer J. Michael Straczynski, a self-professed Superman fan who feels a personal
                    connection to
                    the character,[61] take over writing duties with a short story in the issue,[60] and his run on the
                    title began with issue #701.[62] Artist Eddy Barrows, a previous Action Comics artist and one of the
                    artists on the War of the Supermen event, was Straczynski's artistic collaborator.[63] Straczynski
                    and
                    Barrows began a year-long story entitled "Grounded," that sees Superman begin a long walk across the
                    United States to regain the connection with his adopted home that he feels he lost while away on New
                    Krypton.[64] The series ended with issue #714 (October 2011), prior to DC Comics' The New 52 company
                    wide reboot and relaunch.[54]

                    DC Comics launched Superman volume 3 with issue #1 in September 2011 (cover dated November 2011), as
                    part of The New 52.[65] The first three issues saw George Pérez doing the scripting and breakdowns.
                    DC
                    announced in October 2011 that Dan Jurgens would be co-writing and drawing Superman with Keith
                    Giffen.
                    Their first issue was #7 (May 2012).[66] As of September 2012's #0 Issue, Scott Lobdell and Kenneth
                    Rocafort became the creative team.[67] DC Comics' All Access webcast announced on February 4, 2014
                    that
                    John Romita Jr. would be drawing the Superman series in collaboration with writer Geoff
                    Johns.[68][69]
                    Romita Jr.'s Superman pencils were inked by Klaus Janson.[70] Superman's secret identity as Clark
                    Kent
                    was revealed to the world in a storyline by writer Gene Luen Yang in 2015.[71] This series ended its
                    run
                    with the release of issue #52 (July 2016).

                    The Superman series had annuals published since 1960. Eight issues of Superman Annual were published
                    starting in Winter 1960.[77] An additional four issues were published from 1983 to 1986 and the
                    numbering continued from the 1960 series.[78] Superman Annual #11 (1985) featured the story "For the
                    Man
                    Who Has Everything" by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.[79] When the original Superman series was
                    retitled
                    as The Adventures of Superman, both it and Superman volume 2 received annuals relaunched with #1
                    issues.
                    The Adventures of Superman Annual ran for nine issues from 1987 to 1997.[36] After The Adventures of
                    Superman was restored to its original title as Superman, its annuals continued the volume 2
                    annuals.[80]
